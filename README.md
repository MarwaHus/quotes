# Lab: Class 08

# Quotes

In this lab is about using GSON to parse a JSON file.
To use GSON, you need to create a class that represents the structure of the JSON file you are parsing. You can then use GSON to read in the JSON file and deserialize it into an instance of your class.
Once you have the `Quote` objects, you can choose a random one to display in the App class. The App class can simply call a method on the `Quote` class to get a random quote, and then display the quote text and author in the console.
